# Symplectic structure perturbation

This project contains several notebooks studying how the Fixed Point Iteration solver of implicit relations affect the symplecticity of the Symplectic Euler method. The chosen mechanical problem is the dynamics of a charged particle in tokamak-like magnetic field.

The codebase is written in Julia language. The notebooks are made using [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) and can be opened as any other Pluto notebook.
